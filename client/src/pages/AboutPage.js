          Set with Friends was developed by{" "}
          <Link href="https://github.com/ekzhang">Eric Zhang</Link> and{" "}
          <Link href="https://github.com/cynthiakedu">Cynthia Du</Link> as a
          side project in early 2020. We love the game, and our goal was to
          bridge the distance between friends by creating the simplest interface
          for playing Set online.
